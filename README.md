## MVP's 
User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability. 

Our user stories can be broken into three levels of scope.

Epic, atomic, conditions of satisfaction 

Epic user stories are the highest level and cover a large amount of functionality. Since an epic is generally too large for a team to complete in one iteration, the epic can be split into several smaller user stories. Here is an epic user story example for BFL. 

>As a user, I can join a team

An atomic user story is simply an aspect of its parent user story, the epic. In this case, in order for a user to successfully join a team, they must complete a few other user stories as well. 

>As a user, I can register a player profile on BFL 

>As a user, I can be added to a team by the team captain 

Atomic user stories can be broken down even further into smaller user stories. However, this invites the possibility of overly complicating our goals with too much subdivision. But every user story will generally have conditions of satisfaction: a high-level acceptance test that will be true after the user story is complete. When all of a user stories conditions of satisfaction are true, then a user story is complete. 

The conditions of satisfaction for the first atomic user story might be as follows: 

>An unregistered or non logged-in user must see a registration form in the website's navbar

>User registration emails must be unique in order to ensure that a user isn't registering more than once. 

It should be up to the team member/members claiming the user story to create the user story's conditions of satisfaction and have those conditions vetted by another team member.
